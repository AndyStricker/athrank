===============================================================

Requirements
------------

To connect with Libreoffice Base to the athrank database install the
Libreoffice database connector. The Debian package is named
"libreoffice-sdbc-postgresql".


Connection URL
--------------

Despite its name it's not an URL but a string with key-value pairs.
For example to connect to the postgres itself use this string:

  dbname=postgres hostaddr=127.0.0.1 port=5433 user=db_user password=libreoffice

To connect to the athrank database use this string:

  dbname=athrank hostaddr=127.0.0.1 port=5432

Leave the user and password setting the dialog or specifiy it here too.
