Athrank RESTful Webservice API
==============================

Goal
----

There should be a defined API to read and write the Athrank Database.
The API should allow web applications and client applications to enter
data and fetch data.

Using a buzzword, the API composes a Webservice and therefore goes over
HTTP(S). There are many solutions, some are too complex (SOAP/WSDL)
while other are a bit loose (serving some XML documents). I choose to
fully exploit the richness of the HTTP protocol and implement a RESTful
webservice.

Technical implementation
------------------------

As presentation layer I primary choose JSON, but it's possible to also
serialize to XML (e.g. propritary XML dialect or an Atom feed).
